              <h2>How we created a Lebenese life in bribes</h2>

              <p>
                Dealing with corrupt government officials is depressingly commonplace for the average Lebanese, who must bribe to get everyday government services (for example, obtaining a passport) taken care of in a timely fashion, or indeed at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Sakker El Dekkene</strong> maintains a growing database of bribery data from citizens who report corruption through its app and outreach programmes. Between June 2013 and December 2014, SED received 1,561 bribery reports. We chose procedures with verifiable base costs (e.g. having a car registered) that we also had average bribery data for. 
              </p>
              <p>
                 To tell a story of corruption for a fictional, “typical” Lebanese, we selected common life milestones - from raising a child and going through tertiary education, to getting married and entering the labour market - and then added the estimated average cost of bribes most people would unavoidably have to pay at each milestone. 
              </p>
