                Did you know the average Lebanese will give up the equivalent of 8,850 shawarma, one and a half cars, or 1662 tanks of gas in bribes in their lifetime?

                This is a Lebanese life story in bribes.

              <h2>Methodology</h2>
              <p>
                Dealing with corrupt government officials is depressingly commonplace for the average Lebanese, who must bribe to get everyday government services (for example, obtaining a passport) taken care of in a timely fashion, or indeed at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                 To tell a story of corruption for a fictional, “typical” Lebanese, we selected common life milestones - from raising a child and going through tertiary education, to getting married and entering the labour market - and then added the estimated average cost of bribes most people would unavoidably have to pay at each milestone. 
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Sakker El Dekkene</strong> maintains a growing database of bribery data from citizens who report corruption through its app and outreach programmes. We chose procedures with verifiable base costs (e.g. having a car registered) that we also had average bribery data for.
