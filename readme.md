DEMO

This interactive narrative is based on data collected by <a href="https://www.sakkera.com/">Sakker el Dekkene</a> (SED), a Lebanese non governmental organisation which documents corruption in Lebanon and publicises its consequences to everyday Lebanese. One of SED's key activities is collecting and analysing reports of bribery from the Lebanese public. 

The narrative for this story, breaking down a typical life into distinct stages and coming up with a base set of bribes, was conceived and at Small Media's D4C visualisation workshop in Beirut in November 2015. 

After the workshop's conclusion, I wanted to continue working on the story, so I built a second demo, at <a href="http://radiocontrolled.github.io/cradleToGrave">radiocontrolled.githu.io/cradleToGrave</a>.
