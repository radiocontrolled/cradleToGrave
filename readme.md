DEMO

This interactive narrative is based on data collected by <a href="https://www.sakkera.com/">Sakker el Dekkene</a> (SED), a Lebanese NGO which documents and publicises corruption. One of SED's key activities is collecting reports of bribery from the Lebanese public. 

The narrative for this story, breaking down a typical life into distinct stages and coming up with a base set of bribes, was conceived and at the D4C visualisation workshop in Beirut in November 2015. 

After the workshop I wanted to continue working on the story, so I built a second demo, at radiocontrolled.github.io/cradleToGrave.
